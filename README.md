# Car Management System

This Java-based application is designed to manage cars, their owners, and vehicle registrations. It allows users to register vehicles, link them to their respective owners, and optionally add them to a list of cars for scrapping.

## Tools Used
- **Java**: The main programming language used for the project. 
- **Maven**: A build automation tool used for managing project dependencies and building the project.

## Static Analysis Tools
- **Checkstyle**: A tool for ensuring the code adheres to coding standards and conventions. It checks for issues like naming conventions, indentation, and more. 
- **SpotBugs**: An open-source static analysis tool for detecting bugs in Java programs. It helps identify potential issues like null pointer dereferences, infinite loops, and performance problems. 
- **PMD**: A static code analyzer that finds common coding flaws, such as unused variables, unnecessary object creation, and more, to improve the code quality.

## Testing and Code Coverage Tools
- **JUnit**: A widely used testing framework for Java, which ensures that individual components of the application work as expected. 
- **JaCoCo**: A code coverage tool that integrates with JUnit to measure the test coverage of the codebase and provides reports for further analysis.

## Development Tools
- **Lombok**: A Java library that automatically generates boilerplate code, such as getters, setters, equals, hashCode, and toString methods, reducing the need for repetitive code. 
- **Javadoc**: A tool that generates API documentation directly from the source code, making it easier for developers to understand how to use the application and its components.
- **Maven Site Plugin**: A Maven plugin used to generate a static site containing project documentation and reports. It can aggregate information such as Javadoc, dependency details, test reports, and static analysis results.

## Deployment with Docker

In order to launch the application, you must be running Docker first, then **go to the "Releases" menu and follow the instructions.**
